# Homestead Electric — Feature Tree

Source of truth for every feature in the app, organized by area. The in-app App Map page (`/?appmap=1`) and the AI help box are grounded on a copy of this file that is synced into the bundle automatically at build time — see "How this file is maintained" at the bottom.

**Status legend:** `shipped` · `in-flight` · `planned`

**Last manifest update:** 2026-07-18 · App SW version: v346

  - Crew-on-site = TODAY's Crew Planner · `shipped 2026-07-17` · `SW v342` · `crewOnSiteToday(jobId)` reads `settings/schedule_<monday>` assignments for today's column (weekend/empty → no crew) — replaces the roughStatus/finishStatus "inprogress" guess that hid the approved-CO convert-to-Return-Trip option on any mid-phase job (Nelson); same fix applied to the Up Next approved-CO task title

  - Sits on top of Open Items (doesn't replace it)
  - REPLACES PhaseInstructions UI slot (Option A, 7-layer data safety migration)
- **Open Items** · `shipped` · `JobOpenItems` · return-trips summary + the job's general-scope Job Notes (manual visit/call/purchase capture removed in the 2026-07-10 ops revisit — return trips + Needs Board cover it · `SW v321`)

Display-only — no new writes, no data-shape change
  - New-answer visibility + sort by date answered · `shipped 2026-07-17` · `SW v345` · answered list sorts newest-`answeredAt` first (undated legacy answers sink); per-device seen stamps (`qaSeenAns_<jobId>_<phase>-<floor>` in localStorage, share-page `prevVisitAt` pattern) drive a "N NEW" pill on the ANSWERED header + the phase Answered chip, a "NEW ANSWER" badge + green border per question, and a relative time on the answered stamp; expanding the answered section marks seen (badges persist for the visit, clear next visit).

  - Per-floor home runs
  - By Panel view · `shipped 2026-07-17` · `SW v345` · `HomeRunsByPanel` + shared `HRRow`/`sortHRRows` — groups every non-blank row by panel (dropdown order), then floor (main → basement → upper → extras), then A-Z, with per-panel pulled counts; auto-default once any panel is labeled, By Panel / By Floor toggle; rows fully editable in both views, edits write back to the row's own floor array through the same sort/renumber, adding + bulk paste stay in By Floor. Stored data shape unchanged
  - Bulk paste home runs
  - Generator load section
  - Electrical panel schedules
  - FieldInk home-runs publish (mirror to the PDF markup app)

## Sharing & External Pages

Pages designed to be opened by people outside the company via share links (no auth).

- **Homeowner page** · `shipped` · `HomeownerPage` · `?homeowner=`
- **Home Runs share** · `shipped` · `HomeRunsSharePage`
- **Lighting collab share** · `shipped` · `LightingSharePage` · `?lighting=` · LV company adds module/channel assignments; per-row three-way merge so a stale tab can't drop rows · `SW v313`
- **Panelized loads share** · `shipped 2026-07-07` · `SW v305` · `LoadsSharePage` · `?loads=` · read-only, baseline-locked
- **Lighting hub (Tech Lighting portal)** · `shipped 2026-07-08` · `SW v308/v315` · `LightingHubPage` · `?lightinghub=1` · lists every on-link Lutron job, "to review" + "replies" badges, auto-refetch on refocus, Try-again error state
- **Plan Changes share** · `shipped 2026-07-09` · `SW v313` · `LutronAdditionsSharePage` · `?lutronshare=<jobId>` · per-job change list, Mark incorporated (+ undo, plan-rev note), questions with attachments, job discussion; honors the On-their-link switch
- **Punch share** · `shipped` · `PunchSharePage`
- **Questions share** · `shipped` · `QuestionsSharePage`
  - Answers/notes/photos AUTO-SAVE as recipients type (no Submit needed); Submit stays the formal "done" that closes questions · `shipped 2026-07-09` · `SW v314`
  - Discussion replies live in `homeowner_requests.questionThreads` (side doc — crew saves can never wipe them) · `SW v313`
  - Respondent name badges (replaces hardcoded "GC") · `SW v316`
  - Late link answers can't silently vanish · `shipped 2026-07-10` · `SW v322` · an answer submitted for a question the crew already closed (done, not link-answered) shows an amber "came in after this was closed" note on the in-app row with Adopt (appends to any crew answer, merges photos, content-keyed) / Dismiss — the never-clobber-crew-answers guard stays intact
  - Real reopen · `shipped 2026-07-10` · `SW v322` · unchecking an answered question now clears the who/when stamps, and for link answers snapshots the rejected content (`q.gcRejected`) so the same answer can't auto re-close the question on the next Submit — a genuinely different link answer still applies (and clears the rejection)
  - Link edits/deletions sync live · `shipped 2026-07-10` · `SW v324` · a question the LINK answered (`q.gcAnswered`) now stays content-true to the link on every save: text edits and photo removals propagate, and clearing everything un-answers the question in the app (reopens it, stamps off) — crew-answered questions still can't be touched from a link
- **Job Note share** · `shipped` · `JobNoteSharePage`
- **GC Portal (contractor mission control)** · `shipped 2026-07-16` · `SW v340` · `GCPortalPage` · `?gcportal=<token>` · one live link per contractor showing ALL their jobs — rough/finish status + dates, per-recipient question tracking, return trips, Homestead's own QC-walk receipts, Matterport 3D links, CO counts — co-branded (per-link `accentColor`), "built in-house" provenance. **Kweller-safe by construction:** the page reads ONLY `gc_links/{token}` + `gc_portal/{portalId}/jobs/*` (a server-published, explicit-allowlist projection — `functions/gcPortal.js`), never `jobs/{id}`; questions gated to *effectively shared* only. **Two-way:** GC can answer questions, suggest/confirm dates, add items, message the crew, and assign/change their own supers per job (`GCSuperAssign` → `assign`, applied live to the link; drives the super filter + per-super email routing) (`GCSendBox` → token-authed `gcPortalSubmit` callable → `gc_requests`, office reviews before anything touches a job). Membership = GC-level union across the contractor's links (exclude wins, sticky across revokes); revoke ROTATES the shared `portalId` so a revoked holder keeps nothing. 5 adversarial review passes; unit suites `scripts/gcportal-test.js` + `scripts/gcnotify-test.js`.
  - Co-brand header lockup per spec · `shipped 2026-07-17` · `SW v342` · header now renders the Homestead longhorn white-on-transparent × the GC's own logo image (Robison script creme, from the approved mockup assets, now in `public/`) instead of the app icon in a white box × a text label; `link.logoUrl` wins, built-in `GC_LOGOS` map is the fallback, text label only when no logo exists. Applies to every link ever created: the office link manager gains a "Their logo" URL field, and `gcPortalCreateLink` / `gcPortalUpdateLink` / `gcPortalListLinks` carry a validated `logoUrl` (`gcPortal.cleanLogoUrl` — https-only or bundled `/` path, blocks http/javascript/data/protocol-relative, unit-tested)
  - v343 audit round (Cursor draft → Claude-approved) · `shipped 2026-07-17` · `SW v344` · office inbox labels date anchors (Finish start / Matterport / Return trip / Question); Matterport CTA gated by shared `_gcMpNeedsDate` (card tags + modal can't drift; terminal `complete` excluded), counts toward Need-your-input, confirm-vs-suggest `dateKind` when scheduled; status pills map straight from the official ROUGH/FINISH status set (waiting_date/date_confirmed/scheduled/inprogress/waiting/complete — never `projectedStart` alone); mirror projects `matterportStatusDate` (+2 tests); `gcPortalSubmit` requires a date, validates the anchor against the live mirror, and dedupes open same-anchor requests (`deduped:true`); broken-logo Set resets on link/logoUrl change. Needs `firebase deploy --only functions:gcPortalSubmit`
  - Mockup-fidelity pass + audit fixes · `shipped 2026-07-17` · `SW v343` · cards/modal now match the approved mockup: `#simproNo` job numbers, absolute short dates ("updated 7/15", never "115d ago"), action tags carry dates ("Return trip: needs scheduling (by 7/24)", "Confirm finish date — proj Sep 1"), status pill rows (`_gcStatusPills`) on cards + modal, modal-top ROUGH/FINISH bars, hot summary tiles tinted, "Return trips — need scheduling" label. NEW modal "Needs & scheduling" section: finish-start plan/confirm + Matterport date-suggest, both filing `type:"date"` gc_requests (`itemId:"finish_start"` / `"matterport"`) so the card's action tags finally land on real actions. Cursor-audit fixes: `GC_LOGOS` keyed by `gcKey` (canonical) with label alias, broken logo URL falls down the chain custom → bundled → text (`gcLogoBroken` Set, live-recovering), logo `maxWidth` cap for phones
- **GC notification engine (email v1)** · `shipped 2026-07-16` · `SW v340` · `functions/gcNotify.js` · per the cadence policy (vault spec): ONE 8 PM daily digest per contractor (per-recipient super routing, only if their mirror changed — no-content night = no email) + INSTANT emails for schedule changes, inspection results, milestones (incl. "your house is hot"), Matterport-ready, return-trip scheduled. Instants ENQUEUE to `gc_notify_queue` (5-min drain, idempotent, 5-try cap, quiet hours 9 PM–7 AM defer to morning); emails are composed from the portal projection + a closed set of safe scalars, esc()'d, portal link top + bottom. Provider key lives in function-only `gc_config/mail` — deploys with email OFF, fails safe until configured (SendGrid HTTP via fetch, no new dependency). Texts (Twilio, 3 interrupt triggers only) = v1.5.
- **All public pages**: error toasts render (HEToastHost mounted), failures speak instead of silently dropping input · `SW v315`

## Infrastructure

- **Service Worker** · `shipped` · network-first cache; version bumps trigger fleet-wide refresh
  - Current: `v181`
  - Bumped on every deploy that changes bundle
- **Firestore offline support** · `shipped` · `persistentLocalCache` + `persistentMultipleTabManager`
- **Self-healing live sync + honest LIVE indicator** · `shipped 2026-07-16` · `SW v336` · the board used to go STALE after a laptop slept / WiFi dropped / an extension blocked the Firestore Listen channel: the jobs `onSnapshot` was attached once with no re-attach path and an error callback that only logged, while the header showed a hardcoded green "● LIVE" dot — so the crew stared at hours-old cached data with no cue and no recovery short of a manual reload. Now the jobs listener re-attaches with backoff on error and force-resyncs (tear-down + re-attach → fresh snapshot + resumed live updates) on three triggers: tab returns to foreground after being away, machine wakes from sleep (a wall-clock gap detector, since `navigator.onLine` stays stuck `true` through sleep), and the OS `online` event. The header dot is now wired to REAL state via `snap.metadata.fromCache` + listener health + `isOnline` — green "Live" only when truly synced, amber "Reconnecting"/"Offline" otherwise — and the offline banner also shows on stale-cache/reconnecting. READ-only change: no write path touched, merge/save safety unchanged (saves still re-read the server transactionally). Also fixed the invisible "Show archived" toggle chevron (kebab-case `chevron-right`/`chevron-down` never matched the camelCase icon registry; added `chevronDown`).
- **Scalar-conflict + missing-baseline telemetry (read-only)** · `shipped 2026-07-16` · `SW v338` · adversarial verification of the two deferred merge-safety fixes concluded: (1) the **scalar last-write-wins** hole is REAL — every string/number/boolean in a save patch bypasses `_threeWayMerge` via the `typeof` gate in `_mergePatchAgainstServer`, so a stale device silently overwrites a newer concurrent scalar (worst: whole-textarea notes, compound derived-scalar bundles) — but the safe first step is OBSERVABILITY, not a behavior change; (2) the queued **empty-baseline fix must NOT be built** — "keep-both on empty base" is already the shipped union semantics (`_threeWayMerge` doc: "No baseline available → union merge, never drop"), and seeding the baseline from a `getDoc` of server-current would make the base FRESHER than the local copy (v312 invariant violation) and re-install the client-verbatim clobber. Shipped accordingly: a `[HE] scalar overwrite:` console.warn when the server value changed since baseline AND differs from what we're writing (guards: baseline must exist; `foreman`/`lead` compared through `normalizeName`; `roughStage`/`finishStage` excluded — migrate() reshapes only the baseline side; telemetry NEVER touches the written value, `rescuedKeys`, or the `merged` flag), plus a once-per-job `[HE] merge ran with NO baseline` warn. ZERO write-path changes — v301/v302/v312/v335 invariants pass by construction. Telemetry runs 3–4 weeks to measure real field frequency before any Phase-2 scalar-merge decision.
- **Push notifications (FCM)** · `shipped` · per-foreman; `FCM_MSG.data` shape (NOT `webpush.notification.data`)
- **Honest notification prefs** · `shipped 2026-07-10` · `SW v321` · every toggle in Settings → Notifications is enforced server-side (`sendToNameIfWanted` / `sendToJobCoordinatorIfWanted`); placebo keys removed, 7 real keys added (status_update, milestone_complete, job_hold, failed_inspection, reminder_safety, co_chase, rt_chase); admin blast on every event replaced with coordinator-routed sends
- **Thursday Packet v2** · `shipped 2026-07-10` · `SW v321` · weekly email keeps the update-compliance section; dead "Last Week's Decisions" stub dropped; adds Tech Lighting loop status, PTO next 7 days, open App Map suggestions, fleet staleness line
- (Daily huddle EMAIL removed 2026-07-10 — SMTP had been failing 100% and Koy killed it rather than fix it; the in-app Huddle view and the 6:30 AM huddle push to coordinators both stay · `SW v321`)
- (Daily Job Activity report — deleted in the 2026-07-10 ops revisit; Today view + Thursday Packet cover it · `SW v321`)
- **PWA manifest** · `shipped` · installable on iOS/Android
- **Backup system** · `shipped`

  - `namesMatch()` helper for tolerant folder→job matching
- **Simpro sync** · `shipped` · `simproCandidates` doc, Simpro import flow
- **Activity tracking (lastActivityAt)** · `shipped 2026-05-21` · `SW v180`
  - `lastActivityAt: serverTimestamp()` on all 7 job-write paths
  - Loader at L44066 preserves the field through unwrap
  - Drives the Today command center's activity sort + staleness
- **Smart merge on reconnect** · `shipped` · `_smartMergeForReconnect`
- **Debounced save (`saveJob`)** · `shipped` · hot path for all job mutations; three-way merge + per-tab echo identity (`TAB_ID`, Kweller burst-wipe fix) · `SW v312`
- **Pending patches queue** · `shipped` · `pendingPatches.current` per-job patch accumulator
- **Force update mechanism** · `shipped` · admin can push `config/app` doc to force fleet refresh
- **Always-current auto-update** · `shipped 2026-07-10` · `SW v318` · bundle-baked version (prebuild) vs served SW version; safe self-reload (never mid-typing / with unsaved work), bottom-left update pill, loop guard, device-version pings
- **Link Safety funnel** · `shipped 2026-07-09` · `SW v313` · every `homeowner_requests` write goes through `saveHomeownerRequest` with version snapshots (last 10 per job, `versions` subcollection) — any clobber is a 2-minute restore
- **Nightly Firestore backup** · `shipped 2026-07-09 (deployed)` · 1:00 AM MT cloud function, 30-day retention in Storage `backups/`, `runBackupNow` manual trigger, `settings/backupStatus` stamp feeding the in-app banner
- **FieldInk bridge hardening** · `shipped 2026-07-10` · `SW v323` · CO/questions publishers ABORT when their pre-read fails (a network blip used to silently wipe the crew's plan-markup links); field-note answer relay marks delivered only on success (retries otherwise); all field-ink listeners self-heal with backoff instead of dying silently; home-runs publish debounced 1.5s (was a write per keystroke). Pairs with FieldInk v486.
- **Crew link (FieldInk)** · `shipped 2026-07-10` · `SW v323` · "Crew link" button on job-linked Live Plans rows — Question/Problem pins dropped from that link flow into the job's Questions (finishes the ccfieldnotes loop; both halves existed but nothing minted the `?crew=` tagged link). Senders type their name per note, so one link serves a whole crew/sub.
- **CO plan-markup chip** · `shipped 2026-07-10` · `SW v323` · Change Orders rows show "Marked up on plan — view" when the crew drew that CO on a plan in FieldInk (the write-back had flowed for weeks with no office display)
- **Honest plan-pin badge** · `shipped 2026-07-10` · `SW v323` · question rows distinguish blue "Pinned on plan" (located, not answered) from green "Answered on plan" — pinning no longer force-marks a question answered on either side (FieldInk v486 pairs)
- **HIGH-tier bug-hunt fixes (H1–H8)** · `shipped 2026-07-11` · `SW v325` · stored-XSS escape on public punch share items (H1); `settings/users` token writes now transactional and preserve the anti-wipe guard metadata, client + server (H2/H3); standard-floor Savant panels seed a label so they persist (H4); Job-Note→Punch promote runs `normFloor` so items no longer silently drop on legacy-array floors (H5); Savant slot Save batched into one patch so name/watts/room stop clobbering each other (H6); Drive functions write `updated_at` as an ISO string so the GC "add item" write isn't rejected (H7); all 22 `https.onCall` functions gated behind an app-caller key (H8 — partial; Simpro token rotation + Firebase App Check still pending). Server half (H2/H7/H8) deploys via `firebase deploy --only functions` after the client is live.
- **Data-loss hardening (HD1/HD2/HD5 + M1)** · `shipped 2026-07-13` · `SW v326` · `saveHomeownerRequest` funnel now writes in a `runTransaction` (re-read under lock, `tx.update` only the patched keys) so concurrent writes to different fields on the same `homeowner_requests` doc can't revert each other — fixes all 9 funnel callers (M1). `LightingSharePage` three-way merge moved inside that transaction and its previously-silent save failure now surfaces (toast + "Not saved" indicator) (HD1). Server (`onJobUpdate`) gains a data-loss TRIPWIRE (pushes Koy when one write wipes most of a job's questions/answers/punch/COs) and durable per-field VERSION SNAPSHOTS into `jobs/{id}/versions` (newest 25 — surgical restore beyond PITR's 7-day window) (HD5/HD2). Database delete-protection enabled (HD3). Server half deploys via `firebase deploy --only functions:onJobUpdate`.
- **Answer-wipe fix — kill the auto-retraction** · `shipped 2026-07-13` · `SW v328` · the link-sync effect had a branch that auto-DELETED a question's answer text (and un-answered it) whenever the link's copy looked empty. A device with a stale/empty `questionAnswers` un-answered 17 real designer answers at once and `saveJob` merged the blanks onto the server (same loss class as the original Kweller wipe, different trigger). That branch is removed — the sync NEVER deletes an existing answer; text/photo edits still propagate; a genuine link retraction is now a manual crew reopen. Also: the data-loss tripwire now trips on a big ABSOLUTE drop (≥8 answers), not only ≥50%, so a 17-of-42 wipe pings Koy (the reason this one went unnoticed). Deploy server half via `firebase deploy --only functions:onJobUpdate`.
- **Per-question answer attribution fix** · `shipped 2026-07-13` · `SW v327` · link answers carry ONE shared `questionAnswers.answeredBy` (the last person to submit the link); the auto-apply effect used to re-stamp EVERY answered question with it, so opening a link after the designer relabeled all her answers to the opener (Kweller: 17 of Haley's answers showed "Koy"). The apply effect now prefers the question's own `answeredBy` (`q.answeredBy || gcAnswers.answeredBy`) so a real per-question author is never overwritten by a later, different submitter. Content/photos sync unchanged; the live-sync effect never touched attribution.
- **Generator panel sync + live schedule** · `in-flight` · `SW v329` · (branch `generator-panel-sync`, NOT yet deployed) Generator Load Selection now AUTO-SYNCS from Home Runs instead of a manual import (`reconcileGenLoads` — the gen list mirrors the field's home-run truth; stale office-only loads drop, but a homeowner's *selected* non-match is kept + flagged, never a silent delete). Homeowner submit ↔ office list now reflect each other's picks (`applyHomeownerChoices` — no manual re-checking). A live circuit/space counter + a dedicated generator sub-panel schedule (`GenPanelGrid`, reusing the tuned `placeBreakers` tandem/quad engine) render as loads are toggled; the counter counts REAL placed spaces (not naive poles) so it agrees with the schedule. 14/2 & 12/2 can be flipped to 240V 2-pole 2-wire (`effectivePoles` / `v240`), read app-wide. Default gen panel 40/80. All writes ride the existing `saveHomeownerRequest` funnel; no new top-level fields; dry-run-verified 0 data loss / 0 decision change on real jobs.
- **Generator: Dedicated Loads label + follow-up** · `shipped 2026-07-14` · `SW v330` · one-click reversible "Update Dedicated Loads" stamp puts chosen circuits' Home Run rows on panel "Dedicated Loads" (`stampDedicatedLoads`, prior panel saved to `panelBeforeGen`). Fix: the trigger button's count (`dedicatedPending`) now includes rows that need the label REMOVED (load taken off the generator but still labeled from a prior stamp), not just added — otherwise an un-checked load's label got stuck with no one-click revert. Also `getPanelOpts` de-dupes the always-present built-ins ("Meter", "Dedicated Loads") so a job that saved either into `customPanels` no longer renders two panel cards. Office-side write to the job doc only; reversible; verified live on Kweller (take a 6/3 off → counter −1 circuit/−2 slots, label reverts, Dedicated count 46→45).
- **Plan Changes: edit an existing change item** · `shipped 2026-07-15` · `SW v331` · the "Changes From Original Plan" tracker (Panelized Lighting tab) now has a **pencil / inline edit** on every logged change — before, `changeType` (Added/Moved/Removed/Changed), item type, location, and notes could only be set at add-time, so a mislabeled item (e.g. a removal tagged "Added") was stuck. Edit reuses the add-item form pre-filled and saves via the same `saveRooms` → `u({panelizedLighting.lutronRooms})` job-doc path (version-snapshotted); stamps `editedBy`/`editedAt` (nested). Reflects on Tech Lighting's read-only `?lutronshare=` link.
- **Scoreboard redesign — pure competition, three boards** · `shipped 2026-07-15` · `SW v334` · admin-only `ScoreboardV2` rebuilt from the ~13-signal info/quality blend into three plainly-measured, externally-validated boards with a transparent rank-sum overall (placements added up — no hidden weights). New pure scoring (`sbv3Build`/`sbv3Combined`, alongside the retired `sbv2*`): **First-Time Pass** (rough+final passed first try, STATUS-IMPLIED — a job in finish counts rough as passed, a completed job counts both, unless a fail was logged; lifts the sample from ~24 manually-logged jobs to the whole workload so small-N noise stops crowning people on 2-3 data points); **QC Items/Job** (avg fromQC defects the QC walker calls per walk, lower wins, can't be self-padded); **App Activity** (regular punch + questions logged — entering info directly raises your score, Koy 2026-07-15). Three boards — Coordinators (roll up their book's foremen via the `coordinator` field on `settings/users`), Foremen (`j.foreman`), Leads (`j.lead`). This Week / This Month / This Year window (by recent job activity). Read-only — computes from jobs, writes nothing, no new Firestore field. Dry-run-verified against real data (`scripts/sb-*` harnesses). Old `sbv2*` scoring + `ScoreboardV2Champions/Drilldown/HowItWorks` left defined but unused.
- **Scoreboard v335 — weighted overall + admin-tunable weights** · `shipped 2026-07-15` · `SW v335` · iterated the v334 three-board scoreboard into the design Koy approved: a **weighted Overall standings** board on top (leader = champion; each person's four sub-scores shown inline so the weighting is transparent — no black box) over **four scored sections** — **Quality** (first-time inspection pass + QC items/job), **App Usage** (punch + updates + questions logged), **Shared Links** (question links sent), **Clean Handoff** (open punch per 100 punch items, lower wins — home runs deliberately NOT involved). New `ScoreboardV3` component + `sb3Build`/`sb3Agg`/`sb3JobSignals` scoring (status-implied inspection pass carried over from v334: reached finish ⇒ rough passed, completed ⇒ final passed, a logged fail overrides — full-workload sample, not just manually-logged inspections). **Weights are admin-only and persisted**: an "Adjust weights" editor gated behind `scoreboard.editWeights` writes `settings/scoreboardWeights` (default Quality 40 / App 25 / Shared 20 / Handoff 15); `sb3Agg` normalizes over whatever weights are set, so they needn't total 100. Coordinators (roll up their book's foremen) / Foremen (`j.foreman`, filtered to actual foreman-title users) / Leads (`j.lead`); This Week / This Month / This Year (by recent job activity). Read-only over jobs — the ONLY write is the admin weights doc; no new job field. Render swapped `ScoreboardV2`→`ScoreboardV3`; the v334 `ScoreboardV2`/`sbv3Build`/`sbv3Combined` are now unused. Dry-run-verified: in-app `sb3Build` is byte-identical to the verified `/tmp` compute harness that produced Koy's approved mockup numbers.
- **Scoreboard V4 — median Simpro margin board + Jobs to Watch (admin-only)** · `shipped 2026-07-16` · `SW v337` · new admin-only `ScoreboardV4` replaces V3 at the render site (tab already gated to `scoreboard.editWeights`, so only Koy sees it until approved). **Margin = the MEDIAN of the live `job.simproMargin` field** (matches Simpro; median so one entangled job can't swing it) instead of the frozen `scoreboardJobFinancials` cache; admin weight tool (Margin/QC/Handoff/App) writes `settings/scoreboardV4Weights` (admin-only merge, covered by the existing generic `settings/{docId}` rule — no rules change); live **Jobs-to-Watch** panel flags jobs against a 15%-at-finish margin target. `sb4Build` verified byte-identical to the approved mockup numbers (13/13 rows). Read-only over jobs — no job field added, no loader change. *(Entry backfilled by the v338 ship: the v337 commit omitted its FEATURES.md entry, so the prebuild gate blocked its Vercel deploy — v337 never reached production and ships together with v338.)*
- **Scoreboard V4 — scorecards only + plain-language stats** · `shipped 2026-07-16` · `SW v339` · Koy's first live look: *"these need to be easier to understand what they mean and remove the watch jobs below just have the scorecards."* **Jobs-to-Watch panel REMOVED** (with its target slider, `watch` memo and `target` state; `sb4Agg` still computes `live` for a future re-add). Each person is now one **stacked scorecard** — rank + avatar + full name + big **SCORE** (out of 100) on top, and a 2×2 (4-across on ≥620px) grid of **self-describing stats** below: *Profit margin* (typical job · goal 15%, green/amber/red vs target), *QC items per job* (fewer is better), *Punch left open* (fewer is better), *Logged in app* (punch + updates + questions) — each stat states what it measures and which direction is good, replacing the cryptic `MARGIN / QC / HANDOFF / APP` chips. Card header now explains the score is a weighted blend; weight-tool labels match the new names. Layout carries the v338 fix (no fixed-column grid — `1fr` grids overflow on phones because `1fr`=`minmax(auto,1fr)` won't shrink below a nowrap name); verified in-browser at 375px. Read-only over jobs; only write remains `settings/scoreboardV4Weights`.
- **"Previously answered as X" banner — per-link, not global** · `shipped 2026-07-15` · `SW v333` · the returning-recipient banner on a question share link (`QuestionsSharePage`) keyed off the doc-level `questionAnswers.answeredBy` — a SINGLE field shared by every share link (the last person to submit ANY of them). On Kweller that made all 4 links say "You previously submitted answers as Haley," including the "Koy" link (Koy's answer, mislabeled) and the "Mark Wintzer team" link that had zero answers and was never sent to Haley. Fixed: the banner now shows only when a question ON THIS LINK actually had a prior answer (a `loadedAnsweredIds` snapshot taken at load, intersected with this link's filtered questions), and it names the link's OWN recipient (`shareName`), falling back to the doc-level name only for the generic all-questions link. Display-only change; no write path or data-shape change.
- **Question share-link preview (in-app)** · `shipped 2026-07-15` · `SW v332` · the Share-Questions modal's SAVED LINKS list gains a **Preview** button next to Copy link — it opens the recipient's exact page in an in-app modal `<iframe>` (`/?questions={jobId}&s={shareId}&preview=1`) so the office can see what a person will see without copying the URL and opening a tab. `QuestionsSharePage` reads `?preview=1` and renders its real body inside a disabled `<fieldset>` under a "PREVIEW · read-only" banner (one guard disables every input / attach / submit). Preview is provably write-inert: `handleSubmit`, `runAutoSave`, and `postThread` each early-return on `preview` (belt-and-suspenders atop the existing `userEditedRef` mount guard), so no draft/answer/thread write can fire. No data-model change; no new Firestore field; office-side view only.

## Conventions & Rules

These exist to keep the codebase consistent and avoid past incidents.

- **No emojis in app UI** — use `<Icon name="..."/>` component (SVG paths in `ICON_PATHS`)
- **Mobile + desktop parity** — every flow works on both, no mobile-first or desktop-only designs
- **Features over refactor** — don't propose standalone refactors; lift code only when touching it for a feature
- **Data safety explanation** — every change needs a specific "why this won't lose data" line
- **Complete Firestore rules** — partial rule deploys have broken prod; always include catch-all
- **Verify before replacing** — never overwrite `functions/index.js`, `firestore.rules`, or SW from an old snapshot
- **Don't add fields to `webpush.notification`** — use `FCM_MSG.data` instead (a `data` field on `webpush.notification` killed all pushes silently once)

## How this file is maintained

This file is the source of truth. The in-app App Map page (`/?appmap=1`) and the AI help box are grounded on `FEATURES_MD_INLINE` in `src/App.js`, which is **synced from this file automatically by the prebuild script** (`scripts/version-from-sw.js`) on every `npm run build` — the bundled copy can no longer drift from this file.

Enforcement: **the build FAILS if this file does not mention the service-worker version being shipped** (e.g. `v319`). That means every deploy that bumps the SW cache must also add or update at least one entry here tagged with that version — a feature can't ship without its App Map entry, by construction (Koy, 2026-07-10: "the app map should be flipped and updated whenever one of the features there is built").

If you spot a feature missing, just tell me and I'll add it.
